# Business Rules

1. There must be no overlap between acts as a gig (although one act can start as soon as the previous act has finished, eg. its fine if act 1 finishes at 20:30 and act 2 starts at 20:30).

2. Acts cannot perform in multiple gigs at the same time. Only dedicated in one gig. 

3. Acts can perform multople times at the same gig (e.g. a first half, then an interval, then a second half)

4. Acts only receibe one fee per gig. e.g. if their actgigfee is 1000 pounds, then only receive 1000 pounds regardless of how many times they perform at a single gig. 

5. Each performance is no shorter than 15 mins and no longer than 90 mins. 

6. The same act cannot perform twice without a break (either an interval or a different act playing). 

7. Acts can perform multiple gigs on the same day but need a 60 mins gap to travel between venues (all venues are close together, and dont require different travelling time)

8. Acts can travel to a different gig before the end of a gig (as long as the act has finished the performing)

9. Venues can be used by multiple gigs on the same day (provided that it is not at the same time) but need a 180 mins gap between gigs (so that staff can tidy the venue)

10. All intervals (breaks where no act is playing) must be no shorer than 10 mins and no longer than 30 mins 

11. The first act must start at the same ontime as the gigdateime of the gig. The start date time of the gig = start time of the first play. 

12. For each gig, there should not be more tickets sold than the capcity of the venue. 

13. The final act of a gig must finish at least 60 mins after the start of the gig 

13. Gigs involving genres 'rock' or 'pop' (case sensitive) at any point in the gig must finish no later than 11pm (inclusive) to prevent disruption to neighbouring residents. All other gigs must finish by 1am. 

14. Gigs cannot start after 11:59pm. The earliest a gig can start is 9am. 

15. All times can be assumed to be rounded to the nearest minute.

16. Venue/ Act clashes can ignore cancelled gigs.
